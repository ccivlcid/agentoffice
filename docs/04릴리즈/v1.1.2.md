# HyperClaw v1.1.2 Release Notes

- Release date: 2026-02-21
- Scope: Design system unification for dark/light themes, office visual polish, and readability improvements in learning flows.

## Highlights

- **Theme System + Toggle**
  - Added app-level `ThemeProvider` with persistent `dark/light` mode storage.
  - Added top-bar theme toggle button for instant switching.
  - Kept language preference stable across server restarts by tightening auto-language assignment conditions.

- **Design Tokens and Global Light-Mode Mapping**
  - Introduced semantic theme tokens (`--th-*`) for background, surface, border, text, modal overlay, and scrollbar.
  - Applied broad light-mode token mapping to Tailwind utility classes for consistent contrast behavior.

- **Dashboard / Sidebar / Terminal Visual Refresh**
  - Migrated key UI surfaces to theme-token-based colors for better cross-theme readability.
  - Improved typography contrast for headings, labels, status chips, and metadata in light mode.
  - Standardized panel backgrounds and borders to reduce washed-out UI states.

- **Office View Theme Adaptation**
  - Added dedicated light/dark palettes for office rendering (departments, CEO office, break room, hallway, shell).
  - Office scene now adapts room/furniture/base ambience by active theme for clearer visual separation.

- **Learning Modal + Unlearn Readability Fix (Light Mode)**
  - Improved contrast for Skills Library learning popup text/background.
  - Enhanced `Unlearn` controls and unlearn-center effect card readability in Skill Memory/History sections.
  - Reduced pastel blur perception by strengthening actionable text and button states.

- **Office Screenshot Asset Update (Text-only Note)**
  - Updated `Sample_Img/Office.png` to the latest office design snapshot.
  - This release note intentionally keeps screenshot changes as text-only documentation (no embedded comparison image).
