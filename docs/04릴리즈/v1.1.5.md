# HyperClaw v1.1.5 Release Notes

- Release date: 2026-02-22
- Scope: Task/project creation UX overhaul, project-path safety tooling, orchestration worktree hardening (including non-Git project bootstrap), CLI spawn stability hardening, Decision Inbox review governance (round 1/2), project-level decision consolidation gating/audit trail, and report popup de-duplication.

## Highlights

- **Project-Name Input + Click Dropdown**
  - In `+ New Task`, project selection now starts with a text input (`Project Name`) and click-to-open suggestion list.
  - Keyboard navigation (`ArrowUp/ArrowDown/Enter/Escape`) is supported for fast selection.

- **Inline New-Project Branching**
  - When no project matches typed input, the modal now shows `Create as a new project?` with a right-aligned high-contrast `Yes` action.
  - The previous `No matching project` dead-end flow was replaced with a direct branch.

- **Create Project + Task Together**
  - In new-project mode, submitting the form now creates the project first and then the task in one flow.
  - `Description` is required in this mode and is persisted as the project `core_goal`.
  - New project path entry (`project_path`) is displayed only when new-project mode is enabled and is validated before submission.

- **Desktop/Mobile Layout + Overflow Fix**
  - Desktop: create modal expands to a 1:1 two-column layout when new-project mode is active, with animated right-side reveal for `Priority` and `Assignee`.
  - Mobile: retains vertical scroll behavior to prevent clipping/overflow issues on long forms.
  - Clicking outside the create modal no longer closes it, preventing accidental data loss during path editing.

- **Draft Autosave and Recovery UX**
  - Added local draft persistence (`climpire.taskCreateDrafts`) with autosave on explicit close (`X`, `Cancel`).
  - Added `[Temp(n)]` submodal for inspecting, loading, and deleting temporary drafts.
  - Replaced legacy confirmation dialogs with a styled recovery submodal.
  - Recovery prompt now shows only the latest 3 drafts and allows selecting one before loading.

- **Project Path Finder Suite (Task + Project Manager)**
  - Added three path helper actions: `In-App Folder Browser`, `Auto Path Finder`, and OS-native `Manual Path Finder`.
  - The same path helper controls are now available in Project Manager under `Project Path`.
  - In Project Manager, path helper controls are visible only while creating/editing a project.

- **Project Path Guardrails (API + DB Flow)**
  - Added path utility APIs:
    - `GET /api/projects/path-check`
    - `GET /api/projects/path-suggestions`
    - `GET /api/projects/path-browse`
    - `POST /api/projects/path-native-picker`
  - Added path normalization (`~`, `~/...`, `/Projects/...`, `/projects/...`) for consistent matching.
  - `POST /api/projects` and `PATCH /api/projects/:id` now support `create_path_if_missing` with explicit confirmation flow.
  - `POST /api/projects`, `PATCH /api/projects/:id`, and `GET /api/projects/path-check` now reject out-of-scope paths with `project_path_outside_allowed_roots` when path-root restrictions are configured.
  - Duplicate project paths are now blocked at create/update time with explicit `project_path_conflict` responses.

- **Path Helper Compatibility + Error UX Hardening**
  - Task creation and Project Manager now handle missing helper APIs (`404`) gracefully and fall back to manual path entry.
  - Legacy `alert/confirm` prompts in task creation flow were replaced with in-modal feedback/submodals for a consistent UX.
  - Headless or unavailable OS-native folder-picker environments now show explicit guidance and disable unavailable actions.

- **Task API Project Mapping Hardening**
  - Frontend now passes `project_id` and `project_path` during task creation.
  - Backend now resolves a project by `project_path` when `project_id` is absent, improving project linkage reliability.

- **CLI Spawn ENOENT Resilience**
  - Runtime now appends platform-specific fallback bin directories to `PATH` before provider spawn.
  - This reduces `spawn codex ENOENT` / `spawn claude ENOENT` failures in mixed shell launch environments.

- **Project-Scoped Worktree Enforcement (Orchestration Path)**
  - Restored worktree creation in orchestration `startTaskExecutionForAgent`.
  - Runtime now executes API/HTTP/CLI launches from `agentCwd` (`worktreePath || projectPath`) and logs isolated branch context.
  - Claude runs now ensure `CLAUDE.md` inside worktree via `ensureClaudeMd(projectPath, worktreePath)`.
  - If the target `project_path` is not a Git repo, runtime now auto-bootstraps one (`git init` + initial commit) before worktree creation.
  - Project-path resolution now prefers canonical `projects.project_path` by `project_id` before task/message/cwd fallbacks.

- **Decision Inbox Review Governance (Round 1 + Round 2)**
  - Review rounds 1 and 2 now both pause in Decision Inbox when `revision_requested` is issued.
  - CEO can cherry-pick multiple team-lead remediation opinions in one reply (`multi-select`).
  - CEO can optionally add an extra remediation note in the same decision submission.
  - `Skip to Next Round` is supported for both transitions (round 1 -> 2, round 2 -> 3).
  - Project review action text was normalized to meeting-start wording when representative selection is not needed.
  - Project-level review decisions now enter an explicit `Planning lead is consolidating opinions...` stage and hide options until consolidation is ready.
  - Consolidation summary rendering was normalized for multi-line readability, and single-item cases now include an explicit option guide in the summary.
  - Added persistent project decision audit storage:
    - `project_review_decision_states` for consolidation state/snapshot.
    - `project_review_decision_events` for planning summary, representative pick, follow-up request, and meeting-start events.
  - Project Manager now surfaces those decision events under representative-selection history.
  - Planning-lead decision cards now preserve planner metadata across initial load/live sync, preventing emoji/sprite avatar flicker and keeping a consistent character icon.

- **Single Report Popup After Planning Consolidation**
  - Task report popup/event is now deferred for root tasks until planning-lead LLM consolidation is generated.
  - This removes the prior double-popup sequence (once at completion + once after planning consolidation).
  - Non-root or no-planning-leader fallback paths still emit immediate report events.

- **Task Hidden State Migration (localStorage → SQLite)**
  - Task hide/unhide state was previously stored in browser `localStorage`, causing hidden IDs to be wiped when the server restarts and tasks temporarily arrive as an empty array (cleanup `useEffect` bug).
  - Added `hidden INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` column to the `tasks` table.
  - `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` now accepts `hidden` field.
  - Added `POST /api/tasks/bulk-hide` endpoint for batch hide/unhide by status.
  - Frontend `TaskBoard` now derives `hiddenTaskIds` via `useMemo` from server data instead of `localStorage`; removed all `localStorage` sync and cleanup logic.

- **Report History Two-Level Pagination**
  - Report History modal now paginates the full report list at 5 items per page (footer prev/next controls).
  - Within each page, project-group sub-pagination (3 items per group) is preserved for groups with 4+ reports.
  - Page change resets group sub-pages automatically.
