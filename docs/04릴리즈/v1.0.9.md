# HyperClaw v1.0.9 Release Notes

- Release date: 2026-02-20
- Scope: Report-request workflow hardening for PPT generation, single-pass design checkpoint flow, terminal UX/live-hint improvements, terminal history retention, and multilingual documentation updates.

## Highlights

- **Report Request Workflow (PPT/MD) Improvements**
  - Added explicit report-flow markers in report task descriptions to control orchestration state transitions.
  - Added stricter PPT workflow guidance: web research first, mandatory `ppt_team_agent` skill paths, and pinned submodule usage.
  - Added HTML-first PPT flow guidance and explicit final regeneration rule after design handoff.
  - Added report-request routing preference for Claude Code-capable assignees with department priority.

- **PPT Design Checkpoint Pipeline (One Pass)**
  - Added one-pass design checkpoint delegation to Design team for PPT report tasks.
  - Parent PPT task now pauses to `pending` during checkpoint, then resumes original assignee for final regeneration.
  - After final regeneration, report tasks close directly without additional review meeting (as requested for documentation/report workflows).
  - Non-PPT report/documentation tasks also skip review meeting and close directly on successful completion.

- **Terminal UX and Progress Visibility**
  - Terminal pretty mode now keeps human-readable output while exposing tool-progress hints separately.
  - Added stream parser support for Claude `stream_event` tool-use/input-json deltas so hints appear during long tool executions.
  - Added persistent bottom hint panel above status bar (tool-in-progress + recent hint lines + OK summaries).
  - Progress hints are now returned even when terminal text exists (previously hidden when text was non-empty).

- **Terminal History Retention**
  - Changed task-run log streams from overwrite (`w`) to append (`a`) for CLI/OAuth/API task execution paths.
  - Added per-run log separators (`task run start ...`) so repeated runs keep readable session boundaries.
  - Increased terminal tail retrieval limits in API/UI for better long-run trace visibility.

- **Documentation / README Updates**
  - Added new screenshot examples for report detail and PPT generation output (`Report.png`, `PPT_Gen0/1`).
  - Added `docs/reports/Sample_Slides` source links (HTML/CJS/MJS) and `docs/reports/PPT_Sample.pptx` reference links.
  - Added explicit usage instruction in docs: **Chat window > Report Request button** (Korean: **채팅창 > 보고 요청 버튼**).
  - Updated multilingual README release references and badges to `v1.0.9`.
