# HyperClaw v1.1.9 Release Notes

- Release date: 2026-02-23
- Scope: Post-v1.1.8 reliability fixes for sub-agent status sync, delegated review-gate pause/resume behavior, and Decision Inbox review-round skip routing.

## Highlights

- **Sub-agent Status Sync Hardening**
  - Unknown or out-of-order `agent_status` payloads now trigger canonical live sync instead of appending unknown agents directly.
  - Added bounded Codex thread-binding guardrails (TTL + max-size pruning) to prevent stale thread mapping growth.

- **Codex Thread Binding Cleanup on Completion**
  - When a sub-agent is marked done, related Codex thread bindings are removed immediately.
  - Prevents delayed stream fragments from incorrectly finalizing unrelated/stale sub-agent entries.

- **Delegated Pause/Resume Review-Gate Hotfix**
  - Paused delegated runs no longer finalize linked subtasks as `blocked` on graceful interrupt exits.
  - Linked delegated subtasks are now reconciled after run completion (`done` on success, `blocked` on real failure).

- **Review Completion Auto-heal for Stale Delegations**
  - During review completion, stale `blocked` delegated subtasks are auto-recovered when their delegated task already reached `review`/`done`.
  - Parent review completion is retried automatically once all remaining linked subtasks are resolved.

- **Decision Inbox Round-Skip Routing Fix**
  - Fixed runtime wiring for `scheduleNextReviewRound` used by `review_round_pick -> skip_to_next_round`.
  - Prevents false reply errors and unintended fallback into project-level decision/team-lead meeting flow.
  - Added rollback guard: if next-round scheduling fails, the meeting state is reverted to `revision_requested` instead of staying `completed`.
