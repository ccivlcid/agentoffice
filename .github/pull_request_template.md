## Base Branch Policy

- External contributor PRs must target `dev`.
- `main` is only for maintainer-approved emergency hotfix PRs.
- If merged to `main` as hotfix, `main -> dev` back-merge is required.

## Checklist

- [ ] Base branch is `dev` (or emergency hotfix to `main` with rationale below)
- [ ] Linked issue or context is included
- [ ] Build/tests were run locally (or reason provided if skipped)
- [ ] Docs/README were updated if behavior or setup changed

## Hotfix Rationale (required only when base is `main`)

<!-- Explain why this must go directly to main and who approved it. -->
